## What I did?

I started solving the tasks after 3 years of react abstinence. It was a lot of fun. The fitst two tasks were relatively easy to solve. Even though I solved the second tasks also in react. I hope that was OK. In the middle of the third task, the time was up, but I was still hanging in with some mock-data, because the given mock api seems to not be accessible. So, I used a different one, also I used axios.

But, I was triggered and thought that you can actually solve all three things in a more fun way. So, the alternative counter can add and substract. Much more fun in my opinion. And, the contact dialer has now a search bar you can use to search for your contacts. Please have a look because this person only knows four people. Nevertheless, I thought, I solve the third as good as I can without the working mock-api and just used also fetch in the Mounting...unfortunately, it is endlessly loading ðŸ˜…

Anyway, I had a lot of fun doing react.
